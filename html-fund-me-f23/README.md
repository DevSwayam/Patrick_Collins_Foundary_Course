This is a minimalistic example what you can find in the [metamask docs](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/create-dapp.html#basic-action-part-1).

# Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you've installed it right if you can run:
    - `git --version`
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
  - This is a browser extension that lets you interact with the blockchain.

### Optional Gitpod

If you can't or don't want to run and install locally, you can work with this repo in Gitpod. If you do this, you can skip the `clone this repo` part.
